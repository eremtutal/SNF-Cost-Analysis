**Overview**

The New Jersey Department of Health regulates a wide range of health care settings for quality of care, such as hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living residences, ambulatory care centers, home health care, medical day care and others.
To ensure compliance with regulations, survey facilities investigate number of beds, average length of stay, and the total discharge numbers each year to find the best fit for elderly/sick citizens.
Finally, we certify aides and administrators in settings such as nursing homes to ensure their training, experience and background meet state standards.

According to Skilled Nursing News, the average length of stay in skilled nursing is between 20-38 days, depending on whether you have traditional Medicare or a Medicare Advantage plan and according to the latest AOA (Administration on Aging) research, **the average woman needs long-term care services for 3.7 years, and the average man for 2.2 years**.

With the help of Tableau, these findings provide information that could help patients find the best facility based on their expectations. Some of these findings are the number of beds in facilities to give an idea of how crowded the facility will be, where these facilities are, the length of stay, and comparisons to give the best option.
