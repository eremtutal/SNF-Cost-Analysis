**Overview**

The New Jersey Department of Health regulates a wide range of health care settings for quality of care, such as hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living residences, ambulatory care centers, home health care, medical day care and others.
To ensure compliance with regulations, survey facilities investigate number of beds, average length of stay, and the total discharge numbers each year to find the best fit for elderly/sick citizens.
       Finally, we certify aides and administrators in settings such as nursing homes to ensure their training, experience and background meet state standards.
